`/send`

`/messages`

###1) Fork this repo
Click the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of this page.

###2) Clone your new repo into a Cloud9 account workspace

**NOTE: It is common practice to push your changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your manager will be grading you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

###3)

Use the starter code in index.html and script.js
