##References/Tools


##Instructions

The chat server is located at https://node-slack-christopherjkim.c9.io/ and provides 2 api routes:

`/send`

`/messages`

###1) Fork this repo
Click the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of this page.

###2) Clone your new repo into a Cloud9 account workspace
1. Copy the "clone URL" from your new repository
2. In your Cloud9 dashboard click on the "Create a New Workspace" button and select "Clone from URL"
3. Give this workspace a name that is appropriate and be sure it is set to public
4. Insert the clone URL from this repo and select a custom template

Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push your changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your manager will be grading you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`
